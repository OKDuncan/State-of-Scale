# State-of-Scale
[State of Scale](stateofscale.com) is an educational hackathon event focused on unlocking the potential for L2 solutions to enable development of usable blockchain (re: Ethereum) applications.

Thanks for joining in on this journey of hackathondome. This is an inagural Ethereum focused hackathon in the city of Los Angeles running from July 19-21st. It stems from an workshop series that began in 2018 where L2 teams across the ecosystem  congregated to share ideas and find new ways to leverage this emerging technology. The State of Scale hackathon is the first time we are putting these thoughts into action.

This repo is meant to coordinate the bounties put up for the hackathon. 

Instructions for bounty sponsors below:

1. Create description of issue in this repo, or your own team repo. This should define 1) Project Description, 2) Submission Requirements, 3) Judging Criteria.
2. Fill this [form](https://gitcoin.co/funding/new?type=public) (_NOTE_ Project Type = Public, Bounty Settings = Contest & Permissionless).
3. Submitt bounty through Metamask.
4. Once submitted please send a link to support@stateofscale.com.

There will be a discord server we will direct hackers to discuss details with bounty sponsors throughout the hackathon.

Excellent, tyty, will be in touch soon.
