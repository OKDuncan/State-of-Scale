# State-of-Scale
[State of Scale](stateofscale.com) is an educational hackathon event focused on unlocking the potential for L2 solutions to enable development of usable blockchain (re: Ethereum) applications.

Thanks for joining in on this journey of hackathondome. This is an inagural Ethereum focused hackathon in the city of Los Angeles running from July 19-21st. It stems from an workshop series that began in 2018 where L2 teams across the ecosystem  congregated to share ideas and find new ways to leverage this emerging technology. The State of Scale hackathon is the first time we are putting these thoughts into action.

This repo is meant to coordinate the bounties put up for the hackathon. Instructions below:

1. Create description of issue in this repo, or your own team repo. This description should clearly indicate what factors the hackathon projects must incorporate to qualify for your prize.
2. Fill this [form](https://gitcoin.co/funding/new?type=public) (_NOTE_ Project Type = Public, Bounty Settings = Contest & Permissionless).
3. Submitt bounty through Metamask.
4. Once submitted please send a link to support@stateofscale.com.

Excellent, tyty, will be in touch with next steps soon.
